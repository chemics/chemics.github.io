I am Ziqi Wang, currently a Ph.D. student majoring in theoretical chemistry at University of Pennsylvania. Before that, I finished my undergraduate study and received BSc in Chemistry (chemical physics division) at University of Science and Technology of China (USTC).

My research interests are mainly in quantum dynamics of atomic and molecular systems, with a special focus on energy transfer in elementary chemical processes.

You can contact me by email or through [Contact](#contact) section.
