Welcome to my homepage!

I am Ziqi Wang, currently a Ph.D. student in theoretical chemistry at University of Pennsylvania. Before starting my Ph.D. program, I completed my undergraduate and received BSc in Chemistry (chemical physics division) at University of Science and Technology of China (USTC).

My research interests are mainly in quantum dynamics of molecular systems, with a special focus on energy and electron transfer in elementary chemical processes. My interests outside academia are posted on my [Blog](http://dreamlands.top/).

Feel free to contact me for academic discussion. Some notes on selected topics in theoretical chemistry can be found [Here](#notes).
