I am Ziqi Wang, a student aiming to expolre the theory of chemical dynamics. I joined Boston University (BU) as a chemistry Ph.D. student advised by Prof. David Coker in spring 2025. I completed my undergrad and received my Bachelor's degree at University of Science and Technology of China, then came to University of Pennsylvania as a Ph.D. student before moving to BU.

My research interest is mainly about using path integral method to study chemical dynamics of quantum systems. My interests outside academia are posted on my [Blog](http://blog.ziqiwang.net/).

Feel free to contact me for academic discussion. Notes on some selected topics in theoretical chemistry can be found [Here](notes).
