I am Ziqi Wang, an incoming (spring 2025) Ph.D. student majoring in theoretical chemistry at Boston University. I was a Ph.D. student at University of Pennsylvania from fall 2023 to spring 2024. Before that, I completed my undergraduate and received BSc in Chemistry (chemical physics) at University of Science and Technology of China (USTC).

My research interests are mainly in quantum dynamics of molecular systems. My interests outside academia are posted on my [Blog](http://blog.ziqiwang.net/).

Feel free to contact me for academic discussion. Some notes on selected topics in theoretical chemistry can be found [Here](notes).
